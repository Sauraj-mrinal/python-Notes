#   l   ->      21 
 
# round function -> it is use to round the number 
#  syntex ->  round (number , number of digits)
# 21.333333332 - > 21.33 -> it will become in two digit numbe r

# example -> 

print (round (7 )) #7

print (round (  7 ,2) ) # 7

print (round (7.16)) # 7 
print (round (2.666,2)) # 2.67
print(round (2.6657, 0)) # 3
print  (round ( 7.5)) #  in this case we hvae two case 
# eithe it will return 7 or 8 
# the nearest even  value is 8 
# why we are chosing nearest value -> bcz it is 7.5 -> 5 is a midd value 
# so we can say that if  it is greater than 5 then we should return next value 
# if it is not greater then 5 then the value will we same 

print( round (11.4)) # 11
print( round ( 11.5)) # 12 it will take nearest even number 
print( round (12.5)) # 12 nearest even value is 12 



print( round (674 ,2))# will return the same number 

print( round (674 ,0)) # it will return same number 
print( round (674 ,-1))

# it will return the nearest vlaue of  multiple of the 10 ^ -(-1) 
# in this case it is multipal of 10 is -> 670 or 680
