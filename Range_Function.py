# we can generate a sequence of number using range ( ) function .range (10) will generate number from 0 to 9 ( 10 number )\
# ( 10 number )-> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]

# we can also define the start and end and step size as 
# range (start , stop , step size)

a = range(10)
print (a) #range(0, 10)

# to conver it into list and store the value of it 

b = list(range(10))
print (b) #[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

#  range (start , stop , step size)


a = list(range(3,10,2))
print(a); # [3, 5, 7, 9]
